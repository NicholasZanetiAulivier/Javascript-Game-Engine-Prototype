# Javascript Game Engine Prototype
Javascript Game Engine Prototype is a personal project by me made solely for the purpose of learning how game engines work. This prototype gathers a lot of inspiration from [LÃ–VE 2D](https://www.love2d.org/), an open source game development framework made for Lua. This is likely going to be a solo project until I've decided that the game engine is complete (not necessarily finished), so for now, there's no way for other people to contribute to this repository.
